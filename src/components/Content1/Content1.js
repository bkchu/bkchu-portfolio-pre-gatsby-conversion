            As a developer and a designer, achieving function with form is the
            motto I live and code by. I'm passionate about weaving crisp
            aesthetics into clean, modular code, resulting in a product that's
            easily maintable and beautifully engaging. Having learned a full web
            development stack within three months, I have grown to enjoy
            learning and building new things everyday.
